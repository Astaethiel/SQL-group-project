### SQL: creating database queries

## **Overview**

#### This assignment requires you to create a series of database SQL queries. The specification for each 

**SQL query takes the form of a transaction description. Results from the SQL queries are to be 
automatically marked. For this to happen, students are required to formulate their SQL answer 
statements placing them in the correct file in the intended location. Details also provide students with 
instructions on how to check their answers before submission.**

## **Learning Outcomes**

This assessment has the following learning outcomes.
  
  1. Demonstrate knowledge of the fundamental concepts and principles associated with query languages 
such as SQL.
  2. Demonstrate knowledge of techniques used to create SQL statements.
  3. Demonstrate knowledge of tools used to implement SQL.
  4. Demonstrate knowledge of professional and ethical practices used in the communication and 
development of SQL.

### **Overall Contribution**

This assessment will count for 40% of the overall mark for the module.

### **Hand-in**

This assessment is due at 23:59:00 on the DEADLINE DATE (SPECIFIED ON MYABERDEEN COURSE WEBSITE). 
Completion up to 24 hours late will attract a 10% penalty, while handing in up to 7 calendar days late will 
attract a 25% penalty. Both penalties will be deducted as a percentage of the mark obtained. Work completed
in more than a week late will be treated as a “no paper”.
Completion should take place via myAberdeen. **E.g., “Please upload a single .ZIP file containing the code 
file, the unchanged database file and a PDF of your group’s reflections on each SQL statement.”

### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism is a serious offence, and will not be tolerated. If you are unsure about whether your work counts as 
plagiarised, please contact the course coordinator before the submission deadline. For further details, please 
refer to the Code of Practice on Student Discipline ( https://tinyurl.com/y92xgkq6).

## **Assessment Tasks**

The SQL statements (containing between 10-25 items) incorporate the following features:

  1. Feature to check whether the SQL is the correct answer.
  2. Feedback, stating whether answer correct.
  3. Multiple attempts, allowing learners to determine the correct answer.
  4. Monitoring, highlighting leaners at risk.

## **Marking Scheme**

Refer to the assessment rubric accompanying this document.
Note: CGS A1 will be awarded if 90% or more of the SQL statements are deemed correct in terms of retrieving 
the expected data, using the correct syntax and conventions, and providing a report containing insightful 
reflections on the following:

- What process was followed to implement a solution (i.e. was solution built up and if so in what order?)
- How successful was the process (i.e. which parts of solution worked/not worked?)
- Why was this the best solution (i.e. how might the solution be improved?)

Important: Students are able to resubmit the SQL assessment to Myaberdeen a limited number of times up until 
the deadline, to improve on their mark.
